    <h2>Market Analysis</h2>
    <div class="market-figures">
      <div class="figure-item">
        <h3>Total Addressable Market (TAM)</h3>
        <p>The total event planning market size is $100 billion annually.</p>
        <p>20% of the market is currently interested in or adopting eco-friendly event planning practices.</p>
        <p>TAM = $100 billion * (20 / 100) = $20 billion</p>
      </div>
      <div class="figure-item">
        <h3>Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM)</h3>
        <p>SAM represents the portion of the TAM that our business can realistically target.</p>
        <p>Assuming our initial market penetration strategy focuses on weddings, which make up 30% of the TAM.</p>
        <p>SAM = $20 billion * (30 / 100) = $6 billion</p>
      </div>
      <div class="figure-item">
        <h3>Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)</h3>
        <p>SOM represents the percentage of the SAM that our business realistically expects to capture in a specific time frame.</p>
        <p>Assuming a conservative 5% market share within the wedding segment in the first year.</p>
        <p>SOM = $6 billion * (5 / 100) = $300 million</p>
